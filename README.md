# SensorGraphX

This Android App is used to connect via Wi-Fi to a prototype device with sensors specialized for indoor navigation. Its primary function is to display your relative (X,Y) position as well as relative altitude (Z) position.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Note
You may want to check out my documentation for the project code [here](https://anthonyskoury.github.io/SensorGraphX/).

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android development and deploying
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
* [Developer options](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-get-developer-options-on-android/) to deploy your app onto your phone through Android Studio
* [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) driver needed for your PC to deploy and debug a connected Android device


Knowledge and skills needed

* Programming Java and some XML to some extent
* General understanding of Android API for needed Libraries and Classes


### Installing

To get a developer environment running please do the following:

#### Initial setup

* Have Android Studio downloaded
* Open it and do first time settings

#### Creating the project

* Create a new project in Android Studio
* Clone the repository via [Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) or through Android Studio itself

#### Project Setup

* Build the project (green hammer on top right corner) then press Run (green triangle top right corner) for first time testing


#### Demo

## Building then running the program

If your program does not build successfully, follow the errors from the log to debug the issue

### Debugging the program

To debug your app, you need to press the green bug icon on the top right corner, please follow a [tutorial](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug) on how to use debugger features


## Deployment

You can run your app from Android Studio on a device emulator in Android Studio itself or deploy on your physical Android device.
For deploying on a physical device follow these steps

* You will need to enable [developer mode](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-get-developer-options-on-android/) on your Android device in order to run apps from Android Studio.
* Make sure [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) driver is installed on your PC so Android Studio recognizes your device.

Simply build then press run, selecting your connected device to deploy the test app through Android Studio.

After finalizing your app development you may want to try deploying your app to the Play Store
